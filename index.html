                    atOptions = {
                        'key' : '28e0381782b75d3d6fdd3c563dd50869',

<h2>1. Choosing a Theme and Color Scheme</h2>
<p>Selecting a theme helps unify the overall look of the room and makes decorating easier. Popular themes include:</p>
<p>Jungle Safari: Animal prints, leafy greens, and plush animal toys.</p>
<p>Under the Sea: Blue hues, sea creatures, and ocean-inspired elements.</p>
<p>Fairy Tale Wonderland: Pastel colors, fairy lights, and whimsical decor.</p>
<p>Space Adventure: Planets, stars, and rockets for an out-of-this-world vibe.</p>
<p>A neutral or pastel color palette works best as a backdrop, allowing for versatility as your toddler’s preferences evolve.</p>
<h2>2. Functional and Safe Furniture</h2>
<p>Safety is paramount when choosing furniture for a toddler’s room. Opt for:</p>
<h2>A low-height toddler bed to prevent falls.</h2>
<p>Soft-close drawers and rounded edges on furniture to avoid injuries.</p>
<p>A sturdy bookshelf to store books and toys, secured to the wall to prevent tipping.</p>
<p>Multi-functional furniture, like a convertible crib-to-bed, to grow with your child.</p>
<h2>3. Engaging and Stimulating Decor</h2>
<p>Decor should be visually appealing while also fostering creativity and learning. Consider:</p>
<p>Wall Decals or Murals: Easy-to-apply stickers featuring animals, numbers, or letters.</p>
<p>Interactive Walls: Chalkboard paint or magnetic walls for creative expression.</p>
<p>Personalized Elements: Name signs, framed artwork, and DIY crafts to make the space unique.</p>
